# Situation Monitor: Global Conflict Intelligence Platform

## Build Specification for Replit

---

### Project Overview

Build a comprehensive real-time global conflict monitoring and intelligence platform that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes multi-source data on a Google Maps interface. The system uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for intelligent analysis and prediction generation.

3. LLM Analysis (using OpenAI or local model):
   
   System Prompt for Conflict Analysis:
   """
   You are a senior intelligence analyst specializing in 
   global conflict monitoring. Analyze the provided context 
   from multiple sources to:
   
   1. Summarize current situation
   2. Identify key developments in last 24h
   3. Assess credibility of reports (cross-reference)
   4. Identify information gaps
   5. Provide probability assessments where possible
   6. Flag early warning indicators
   
   Always cite your sources. Distinguish between confirmed 
   events and unverified reports. Use phrases like "multiple 
   sources confirm" or "single unverified report claims".
   """

4. Output structured analysis:
   {
     "summary": "string",
     "key_events": [...],
     "threat_level": 1-10,

GLOBAL OVERVIEW (toggle view):

┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ GLOBAL CONFLICT MONITOR        [Map View] │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐      │

- Mini sparklines inline
```

#### Step 6.2: Automated Report Generation

```
Build /backend/analysis/report_generator.py:

Generate daily intelligence briefs:

1. Report Structure:

```

#### Step 6.3: Alert System

```
Build alert system:

Backend: /backend/analysis/alerter.py

Alert Types and Thresholds:

CRITICAL (immediate push):
- Threat level increase >10 points in 1 hour
- Prediction market move >15% in 1 hour
- Major infrastructure outage

HIGH (prominent notification):
- Threat level increase >5 points in 1 hour
- New conflict event severity >8
- Significant troop/vessel movements
- Multiple corroborating sources

MEDIUM (feed priority):
- Notable events (severity 6-8)
- Prediction market moves 5-15%
- Single source high-impact reports

LOW (standard feed):
- Routine updates
- Minor events
- Background monitoring

Frontend: /frontend/src/components/AlertBar.jsx

Alert Presentation:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🚨 CRITICAL: Significant military activity     │
│ detected near [location]. Multiple sources     │
│ confirming.                    [View] [Dismiss]│
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Features:

### Phase 7: Deployment & Operations

#### Step 7.1: Environment Configuration

```
Create .env file:

# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Reddit API
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=SituationMonitor/1.0

# Twitter/X Cookies (extract from browser)
TWITTER_CT0=your_ct0_cookie
TWITTER_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token

# Data Sources
ADSB_API_KEY=optional_key
MARINE_TRAFFIC_API_KEY=optional_key

# Database
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./situation.db

# Vector Store
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR=./chroma_data
# or PINECONE_API_KEY if using Pinecone

# Server
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
DEBUG=false
```

#### Step 7.2: Replit Configuration

```
Create replit.nix:

{ pkgs }: {
  deps = [
    pkgs.python311
    pkgs.nodejs-18_x
    pkgs.redis
    pkgs.geckodriver
    pkgs.chromium
  ];
}

Create .replit:

run = "bash start.sh"
entrypoint = "backend/main.py"

[deployment]
run = ["bash", "start.sh"]

Create start.sh:

#!/bin/bash

# Start Redis
redis-server --daemonize yes

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages

# Install Node dependencies
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Build frontend
cd frontend && npm run build && cd ..

# Start backend (serves built frontend)
python backend/main.py
```

#### Step 7.3: Data Collection Scheduler

```
Build /backend/scheduler.py:

Use APScheduler or asyncio tasks:

Collection Intervals:
- Reddit: Stream (real-time) + poll every 2 minutes
- Twitter: Stream (real-time via cookies) + poll every 1 minute
- Prediction Markets: Every 5 minutes
- OSINT Feeds: Every 10 minutes
- Flight Tracking: Every 30 seconds (active zones) / 5 minutes (global)
- Marine Tracking: Every 2 minutes (active zones) / 15 minutes (global)
- Infrastructure: Every 5 minutes
- Economic: Every 15 minutes

Analysis Jobs:
- Threat level recalculation: Every 5 minutes
- Prediction updates: Every 30 minutes
- Daily report: 0600 UTC
- Vector database maintenance: Daily at 0300 UTC

Rate Limiting:
- Implement exponential backoff
- Track API quota usage
- Graceful degradation if limits hit
```

#### Step 7.4: Monitoring & Logging

```
Build /backend/monitoring.py:

Track:
1. Collector Status:
   - Last successful fetch per source
   - Error counts
   - Rate limit status

2. Data Quality:
   - Events collected per hour
   - Source distribution
   - Geocoding success rate

3. System Health:
   - Memory usage
   - Database size
   - WebSocket connections

4. Analysis Performance:
   - RAG query response times
   - Prediction accuracy tracking
   - Embedding generation rate

Display in admin panel:
/admin (password protected)
- All metrics dashboards
- Manual collector triggers
- Cache management
- Error logs
```

---

### Phase 8: Additional Data Sources (Enhancement)

#### Step 8.1: SIGINT Proxies (Public)

```
Sources that aggregate signals intelligence indicators:

1. Radio Monitoring:
   - WebSDR stations (public HF receivers)
   - Monitor for unusual military frequencies
   - EAM (Emergency Action Message) watchers

2. Satellite Imagery:
   - Sentinel Hub (free tier)
   - Planet Labs (if budget allows)
   - FIRMS (NASA fire data - often shows strikes)
   - Synthetic aperture radar for night/cloud

3. Seismic Data:
   - USGS for potential nuclear tests
   - NORSAR for North Korea monitoring
   - Correlate with reported explosions

4. Space Tracking:
   - Space-Track.org (requires registration)
   - Monitor military satellite movements
   - Launch detection

Implementation:
- Add to collectors module
- Lower update frequency (hourly)
- Higher credibility weight when available
```

#### Step 8.2: Document & Report Ingestion

```
Build /backend/collectors/document_ingester.py:

Ingest long-form intelligence products:

Sources:
- ISW daily reports (PDF/HTML)
- CSIS analysis pieces
- Government reports (State Dept, DOD)
- UN reports
- Academic papers (conflict studies)

Processing:
1. Fetch documents (PDF, HTML)
2. Extract text with structure
3. Chunk into semantic sections
4. Generate embeddings
5. Store with metadata:
   - Source organization
   - Publication date
   - Author/analyst
   - Region/topic tags

RAG Integration:
- Include in context retrieval
- Weight by recency and source authority
- Link to original documents
```

---

### Testing & Validation

```
Before deployment, validate:

1. Data Collection:
   - Each collector retrieves data successfully
   - Rate limits respected
   - Error handling works
   - Geocoding produces valid coordinates

2. Analysis:
   - RAG retrieves relevant context
   - Threat calculations produce sensible results
   - Predictions are generated correctly
   - Reports are coherent

3. Real-time:
   - WebSocket connections stable
   - Updates delivered promptly
   - No memory leaks over time
   - Graceful reconnection

4. Frontend:
   - Map renders correctly
   - Markers appear at correct locations
   - Layers toggle properly
   - Filters work as expected
   - Mobile responsive

5. Security:
   - API keys not exposed
   - CORS configured properly
   - Input sanitization in place
   - No PII leakage
```

### Notes on Data Source Reliability

```
CREDIBILITY TIERS (assign to all data):

Tier 1 - Confirmed (weight: 1.0):
- Government official statements
- Major wire services (Reuters, AP)
- Satellite imagery confirmation
- Multiple independent OSINT confirmations

Tier 2 - Reliable (weight: 0.8):
- Established journalists
- Known reliable OSINT accounts
- Think tank analysis
- Prediction markets (high liquidity)

Tier 3 - Plausible (weight: 0.5):
- Single OSINT source
- Regional news outlets
- Social media with some verification
- Low liquidity prediction markets

Tier 4 - Unverified (weight: 0.3):
- Anonymous social media
- Single witness accounts
- Rumors and speculation
- Unconfirmed reports

ALWAYS:
- Cross-reference across sources
- Note confidence levels
- Track source accuracy over time
- Flag contradictory information
```

This specification provides a complete blueprint for building a global conflict monitoring system. Start with Phase 1-3 to establish core data collection and analysis, then build out the frontend in Phase 4-5, and add refinements in Phase 6-8.
